# Dr.-Semmelweis-and-the-Discovery-of-Handwashing

Hey There, 

This project is a part of a series of projects on [Datacamp.com](https://learn.datacamp.com/) for Data Science with Python [Career Track](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python?version=5)

It is a guided project offering the datasets and what kind of analysis is needed with them while allowing you to perform the code that executes these functions.

In the End, it offers a series of tests to make sure the output the code generates matches what is expected of the output.

This code tests a dataset of the data produced by clinics for the difference washing hands made when compared against infections and mortalities in this clinic and how they dropped down instantly after using handwashing techniques as a must before doing any operation on patients
